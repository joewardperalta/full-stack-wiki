# Introduction to HTML

## What is an HTML?

**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is a markup language used to define the structure and content of a web page. It consists of a set of **tags (elements)** that give meaning to different types of content, such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images.

### For Example

```html
<p>My name is Joeward Peralta</p>
```

This is an example of a **paragraph element** (`<p>`) that contains the text content: "_My name is Joeward Peralta_".
