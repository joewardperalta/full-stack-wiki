# 📚 FullStackWiki

**FullStackWiki** is my personal knowledge base for learning and mastering **full-stack web development**.  
It’s an open collection of notes, code snippets, best practices, and explanations — written in simple language so anyone (beginner to advanced) can learn from it.

---

## 🚀 Purpose

- Document my learning journey as a full-stack developer
- Create a reference for **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Backend, Databases, and DevOps**
- Share resources, examples, and notes with anyone learning web development
- Keep everything in one place, like a **developer's wiki**

---

## 📂 Structure

The wiki is organized into categories:

- **HTML** → Tags, semantics, forms, accessibility
- **CSS** → Selectors, layout (Flexbox, Grid), animations
- **JavaScript** → DOM, ES6+, async/await, APIs
- **React** → Components, props, state, useState, useEffect, conditional rendering
- **Backend** → Node.js, Express, authentication, authorization, security
- **Databases** → SQL, NoSQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Full-Stack** → Project setups, deployment, best practices
